This is the website of the Statistical Population Genetics Reading Group at the University of Bristol. It's organized by me, [Mauro Camara Escudero](https://maurocamaraescudero.netlify.com/), a Computational Statistics and Data Science (COMPASS) PhD student. I also co-organize the [Neural Network Reading Group](https://neuralnetworksbristol.netlify.app/).
